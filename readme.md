## 🚀 Node.js DigitalOcean Spaces 🦈

This repository provides integration of the DigitalOcean Spaces API into a Node.js application. It allows you to upload, delete, and retrieve files from your DigitalOcean Spaces bucket. 📁💻🚀
This repository only uses S3Client from the @aws-sdk/client-s3 dependancy without the need of multer or multers3 and following the official docs found here :
- https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/ 
- https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/reference/s3-sdk-examples/

### Prerequisites 📋

Before using this code, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine 🖥️
- DigitalOcean Spaces API credentials (access key, secret key) 🔑
- DigitalOcean Spaces endpoint URL 🌐
- DigitalOcean Spaces bucket name 🗄️
- Set up environment variables using a `.env` file or other methods (see `.env` file example) 📝

### Installation 💾

1.  Clone the repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/necromancer26/nodejs-digital-ocean-spaces.git`

2.  Install the dependencies:

    `cd nodejs-digital-ocean-spaces npm install`

3.  Set up your environment variables:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the following variables and provide the corresponding values:

      ```
      DO_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key 
      DO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key 
      DO_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint 
      DO_REGION=your-region DO_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
      ```
      
4.  Start the application:

    `npm start`

### Code Explanation 💡

The main components of the code are as follows:

- `index.js`: This file sets up the Express server, middleware, and routes. It listens for requests on the specified port. 🚀🔌🌐
- `utils/s3Client.js`: This file configures the S3 client using the AWS SDK for JavaScript. It uses the provided environment variables to establish the connection to DigitalOcean Spaces. 🗂️🔑📁
- `services/objectStorageServices.js`: This file contains the implementation of the S3 API. It includes functions to upload, delete, and retrieve files from DigitalOcean Spaces. ⬆️⬇️🔄
- `routes/routes.js`: This file defines the Express router and the API endpoints for file upload, deletion, and retrieval. It uses the services from `objectStorageServices.js` to perform the corresponding actions on DigitalOcean Spaces. 🛣️📡

### Usage 📝

Once the application is up and running, you can use the following API endpoints:

- `POST /upload`: Uploads a file to DigitalOcean Spaces. Send a `multipart/form-data` request with the file in the `file` field. The response will contain the link to the uploaded file. ⬆️📤
- `DELETE /object-storage`: Deletes a file from DigitalOcean Spaces. Send a JSON body with the file link in the `link` field. ⬇️🗑️
- `PUT /object-storage`: Retrieves a file from DigitalOcean Spaces. Send a JSON body with the file link in the `link` field. The response will contain the file data. ⬇️🔍

Make sure to adjust the URLs and paths as per your requirements.
